# Section 1: Summary of the research 

### Model structure 
To generate the data that helps surgery triage, we make use of a cohort state-transition model, also often called a Markov model, with three health states. These health states are a pre-operation health state, _Preop_, a post-operation health state, _Postop_, and dead _Dead_. From the _Preop_ health state patients, were patients in need for surgery are waiting for surgerey,  they can transition to the _Postop_ health state at the time they are eligable for surgery, they can die, in which case they transition to _Dead_ or they can remain in the _Preop_ health state to wait for surgery. Individual in the _Postop_ health state might die or stay in the _Postop_ health state. _Dead_ is an absorbing state. The state-transition diagram is shown below. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "State-transition cohort model diagram." }
### Model structure 
state_names <- c("Preop", "Postop", "Dead")  # names of health states
n_s         <- length(state_names)           # lenght of the health states

```
We model a hypothetical cohort of representative patients over a lifetime horizon, up to a maximun age of 100 years, using weekly cycles. Since the average age per patient population is different, the total number of cycles is different per disease as the total number of cycles is defined by `100 years - average age in years of patients`. 

The cohort is modeled over several strategies. The first strategy is immediate surgery, defined as surgery within 2 weeks, vs delayed surgery modelled. Delayed surgery is model in intervals of 10 week delays after 2 weeks up to a maximum of 1 year. The main outcome of each modeled strategy is the expected quality adjusted life years (QALYs). These QALYs are calculated using a discount rate of 1.5% as recommended by the [Dutch guidelines] (https://english.zorginstituutnederland.nl/publications/reports/2016/06/16/guideline-for-economic-evaluations-in-healthcare). 
 

## Most important assumptions 
**Model structure:**
- Comorbidities are not taken into account 

- (Artifical) triangular distributions are used for parameter distribution, if the real distribution is not known.

- We assume that all operations are succesful (e.g. reoperation is not taken into account). 

- The SARS-Cov2 virus causing the pandemic situation is not modeled. 

- All patients are assumed to be not infected by COVID-19. 

**Related to Survival/treatment effect:**
- Before surgery the survival without surgery is applicable. 

- After surgery the survival with surgery is applicable. 

- Both survival with and without surgery is not age specific, unless specified. 

- The survival after surgery is not affected by the delay of the surgery. 

- The survival/effect of surgery is similar during an epidemic as compared to a 
normal setting (e.g. the difference of the health care system does not affect the 
patient outcomes).

- We donâ€™t include major complications (major bleeding etc.) of surgery because we assume that these complications are rare and equally distributed among the operations. 

- The SARS-Cov-2 virus does not affect the survival. 

- For transplantation surgery, we do not assume that patients on the waiting list can enter a "crisis state", where transplantation becomes urgent (instead of semi-elective).



**Related to quality of life:**
- The QoL without surgery is constant. This means that surgery delay is not effecting the QoL. 

- The QoL after the surgery is not influenced by the time until surgery. 

- The QoL is not age specific. 

- No disutility of the surgery and during the time to recover from is included. 

- For interventions which only aim to improve survival, the quality of life is constant (preoperative vs post-operative).

- For some disease, surgery delay can cause an inreversable QoL decrease (e.g. getting blind, permanent function loss after fracture). 

- *Add/check: Assumption we have with the QoL when they are equal /below/above*

# Section 2: The model
In this section we describe some of the steps that are done to get the results. We refer to several functions that help to run the model. These files can be found in the appendix of this report but are not shown in full detail because in this report we like to mainly focus on the results. However, it is important to understand how the model is strucured and enourage those interested to understand the code, replicate the results or modify the model for you own needs. 

The main file to run the model is the file called `main.R`. To generate update results of the model and this report this file needs to be executed. 

To get this results the following steps describe the proces conceptually:

1.  **Prepair the R environment for the simulation**

2.  **Load the literature data into the environment** 
And modify it to be used for modeling a cohort using weekly cycles. 

3.  **Model a cohort over time**
A model simulates a cohort of individuals up to an average age of 100 years while keeping track of the distribution of the cohort among hte different health states _Preop_, _Postop_, _Dead_. For example, for the senerio of immediate surgery, surgery within 2 weeks, the cohort is modeled for two weeks using the survival rate before surgery. In these first two weeks of the model the individuals are at risk of dying according to the weekly probability of dying before surgery. If this happens they transition to _Dead_ otherwise they stay in _Preop_. After 2 weeks, those in the _Preop_ all get the surgery, and they make the transition to _Postop_. For the remaining cycles, they are at risk of dying according based on the survival rates after surgery. 

3.1 **Calculate the QALYs**
Based on the generated cohort trace, a matrix that described how the cohort is distributed among the three health states over time, the expected QALYs are calculated. 

4. **Run all surgery senarios** 
Repeat step 3 and 3.1 for a several times of delay for surgery. In our code we make use of a sequence of delay in steps op 10 weeks up to a maximum of 1 year. In other words, we run the model for a senareio of surgery after 2, 12, 22, 32, 42 and 52 weeks. 

5. **Incorporate parameter uncertainty**
Using one parameter value for each model parameter in step 3 and 4 assumes we are certain about this values. However, this is not the case and our parameters come with some uncertainty. Some to this uncertainty is described by the literature, some is based on expert opinion. In order to capture parameter uncertainty on the model outcome we have to repeat steps 3 and 4 several times using different combinations of parameter values drawn from the distribtions. Therfore, we repeat stepts 3 and 4 100 times and calculate the average expected QALYS and the distibution around it.

6. **Repeat for all diseases ** 
Step 3, 4 and 5 are now repeated for all diseases of interest. 


In the paragraphs below we describe how these steps are incorporated in the code. 


## 01 Required packages 
To run the model we make use of some packages which can be downloaded from CRAN as well as a package in development, called `dampack`, which we download from Github. But running the following lines of code one can prepare the computer to replicated the results. In order to install the package from GitHub. The uncommended code about the code `p_load_gh("DARTH-git/dampack")` should be used to load the package into the environment. This should only be done once.  
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
if (!require('pacman')) install.packages('pacman'); library(pacman) # use this package to conveniently install other packages
# load (install if required) packages from CRAN
p_load("here", "dplyr", "devtools", "scales", "ellipse", "ggplot2", "lazyeval", "igraph", "ggraph", "reshape2", "knitr", "citr", "plyr", "stats", "diagram", "EnvStats")   

# load (install if required) packages from GitHub
# install_github("DARTH-git/dampack", force = TRUE) #Uncomment if there is a newer version
p_load_gh("DARTH-git/dampack") 
``` 

## 02 Required functions
In this section we load the functions needed for the model. The functions are stored in the _R_ folder. The file `functions.R` contains some generic functions often used in decision modeling and epidemiological research. Like a function to convert probabilities to rates and adjust a annual rate to a weekly rate as we have in our cycle. The functions in this file aremainly provided by the [DARTH workgroup](http://darthworkgroup.com). 

The files `model.R` and `functions_PSA.R` includes functions specifically writen for this research. The aim of these functions is to efficiently program and to make our code easier to read and more transparent. In section XX we explain the model specific function in more detail, but we will first provide some informationabout the data used by these function. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source("../R/functions.R")       # Load general functions useful for state-transition models 
# Model specific functions 
source("../R/model.R")           # Code of the main model
source("../R/functions_PSA.R")   # Load the PSA function  
```


## 03 Input model parameters
### 03.1 Load parameter data 
We import the the parameters found in the literature for the different populations and different interventions. These parameters are stored in the `Model parameters.xlsx` file in the _data_ folder and a list of reference can be found **ADD REFERENCE TO LITERATURE**

Moreover, we import the the age- and gender-specific mortality rates in 2018, downloaded from the [CBS](www.CBS.nl). 
```{r, eval = runModel, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Load data
param <- data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx("../data/Model parameters.xlsx"))
cbs   <- read.csv("../data/CBS lifetable.csv", sep = ";")
```

### 03.2 Data handling 
This imported data requires some data handeling before it can be used in our model, like adjusting the survival rates and annual probabilities do die to weekly probabilities. As well as translating tumor doubling time from time in days in a weekly unit. 

All model parameters have a mean estimate as well as a describtion. The data describes the type of distribution as well as the parameters required to reconstruct the distribution. As described in the data from the parameters, some of these distributions come from the literature, while others are (artefically) informed using expert opionon.

### 03.3 Prepare 
####03.3.1 Make PSA datset 
We make sure of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the robustness of the model outcomes. In other words, how sensitive are our model outcomes due to the uncertainty of the input parameters. A PSA requires a PSA dataset which contains a set of parameter values drawn from the distribution 
for each PSA iteration. 

To generate this PSA dataset we use the function `make_psa_df` as described in the `functions_PSA.R` file in the _R_ folder. Based on the parameter values and there corresponding distribution the function generate a dataset with parameter values of each iteration of the PSA. This PSA dataset is called `param_psa`, which stands of parameters for the psa. 

The following table shows the distributions of the parameters in the PSA.

```{r table, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
load("../output/psa_parameters.RData")
param_psa <- data.table(param_psa)

#Function to calculate estimate/95% CI
aggregate_psa <- function(x){
  #For small numbers, use 5 decimals
  if(median(x)<0.01){
    paste(
                            sprintf(quantile(x,probs=0.5), fmt="%.5f"),
                            " (",
                            sprintf(quantile(x,probs=0.025), fmt="%.5f"),
                            " - ",
                            sprintf(quantile(x,probs=0.975), fmt="%.5f"),
                            ")", sep="")
  }else{ #Use 2 decimals in general
    paste(
                            sprintf(quantile(x,probs=0.5), fmt="%.2f"),
                            " (",
                            sprintf(quantile(x,probs=0.025), fmt="%.2f"),
                            " - ",
                            sprintf(quantile(x,probs=0.975), fmt="%.2f"),
                            ")", sep="")

  }
}

#Aggregate the parameters to make a nice table
param_psa <- param_psa[,.(Intervention = unique(Intervention),
                          `Estimate, 95%CI` = aggregate_psa(psa_est),
                          Distribution = unique(Distribution)),
                       by=.(Population,Param)]

#Add units
units <- data.frame(Param = c("Age", "QoL_no_tx", "QoL_tx", "Surv_no_tx", "Surv_tx","Tx_eff","Time_noeff_Surv","Time_noeff_QoL"),
                    Unit = c("Years","Utility", "Utility", "Probability per week","Probability per week", "OR/HR/RR", "Weeks", "weeks"))

param_psa$Units <- units$Unit[match(param_psa$Param, units$Param)]


knitr::kable(param_psa, 
             caption = "The parameters with assumed distributions.") 

```



####03.3.2 Make the transition probability matrix 
A key component of Markov model is a stucture called the transition probability matrix that described the probabilities of transitioning from one health state to another and to remain in a health state. The functions `make_m_trans` and `trans_operation` coded in the `model.R` file in the _R_ folder generate this structure. The rows of the matrix describe the health state the individual in the cohort started from, while the colums describe where the individual transitions to. And example is shown below. In this unrealistic example, those in th _Preop_ health state have a 20% change of dying every week and a 80% probability to stay in the _Preop_ state, while after surgery, the group has a 5% change of dying every week. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
state_names <- c("Preop", "Postop", "Dead")  # names of health states
n_s         <- length(state_names)           # lenght of the health states

m_P <- matrix(0, nrow = n_s, ncol = n_s, dimnames = list(state_names, state_names))
m_P["Preop", "Preop"] <- 0.80
m_P["Preop", "Dead"] <- 0.20
m_P["Postop", "Postop"] <- 0.95
m_P["Postop", "Dead"] <- 0.05
m_P["Dead", "Dead"]   <- 1

print(m_P)
``` 

The transition probabilities in our model are depending on the cycle in which the cohort is in. For example, for the senario in which surgery is delayed to 12 weeks, the cohort can not transition from _Preop_ to _Postop_ therefore, the probabilty to transition from _Preop_ to _Postop_ until week 12 should be 0. At week 12, the cohort is at risk of dying and the remaining cohort will get the surgery and transition to the _Postop_ health state. The "switching on and off" of the transition from _Preop_ to _Postop_ is done by the `trans_operation` function. 

This means that the transition matrix is different at different cycles. Therefore, we make a transtion probabilty matrix for every cycles. In more technical terms, we add an extra dimension to the 3x3 matrix, a dimension of the number of cycles. This results in an array of transition probabilities. While running the model the transition probability matrix corresponding to the cycle is used to model what happends to the cohort. 

In the `make_m_trans.R` 
- Describe how we deal with the tumoer doubling reate & how the CBS data is used in addition to the disease specific data

## 04 Run the analysis 
Based on the conceptual algorithm as described in the beginning of this paragraph and the function defined we run the model by excecuting the `main.R` file. Add the end of the file the results are stored in the _output_ folder. These results are used to generate the figures as plotted in section 3. 

The files are:
- `res_psa.Rdata`: a dataframe including the results of the PSA

- `psa_pooled.Rdata`: a dataframe including a summary of hte PSA data

- `input_psa.Rdata` : The input data to make the PSA dataframe 

- `psa_parameters.RData` : The parameter inputs for the PSA run

## 05 Calculate model outcomes 
The main outcome of the model is are the expected QALYs at each time point of surgery. These values are informative, but it might be hard to interpret the effect of surgery delay. Therefore, we calculate the derivative at each time interval using the`calculateDerivative` function from the `model.R` file. This function calculated how many QALYs on average are lost per week of surgery delay within the 10 weeks interval. The more QALYs are on average lost within a week of delay the more a patient can benefit from ealy surgery. This could be a patient population with indicaition for surgery that might need to get prioroty for surgery. While a value of zero indicate that waiting for 10 more weeks within that time interval does not result in an expected loss in QALYS. This indicates that this might be a population with surgery indication can wait a little longer. The function also creates figures of these results, which are stored in the _figures_ folder



# Section 3: Disease specific results

In this section we describe the disease specific results in descending order of urgency.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, error = FALSE}
load("../output/psa_pooled.Rdata")

#Extract the right order of presentation
order_populations <- unique(results_pooled$Pop)[
  order(
    results_pooled[
      results_pooled$delay == max(results_pooled$delay),
      "AAC_delay_med"
      ],
    decreasing = TRUE
    )
  ]
```


## Main results
The following table presents the main results of the model. The results are ordered in descening urgency.

## Impact on remaining QALYs
The following figures represent the impact on the remaining QALYs by delaying surgery. The first figure represents the population for whom the most urgency is required, because delaying this surgery results in the fastest drop in remaining QALYs. 

```{r,echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Dummy figure", fig.width = 2.5, fig.height = 1, fig.align = "center", out.width='50%'}

all_images_QALY <- vector(mode = "character" ,length = length(order_populations))
order_populations <- as.vector(order_populations)

for(i in 1:length(order_populations)){
  p <- order_populations[i]
  p <- gsub(" ", "_", p)
 all_images_QALY[i] <- (paste("../figures/",p,"_QALY.png", sep=""))

```

## Urgency trend
The following figures present the impact of delay on the slope of the line, the derivative. That means that if the line goes down, the urgency goes up (more QALYs are lost per week). This can be used to seek when an interventions becomes especially critical to perform. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 2.5, fig.height = 2.5, fig.align = "center", out.width='50%'}
all_images <- vector(mode = "character" ,length = length(order_populations))
order_populations <- as.vector(order_populations)

for(i in 1: length(order_populations)){
  p <- order_populations[i]
  p <- gsub(' ', "_", p)
  all_images[i] <- paste("../figures/",p,"_derivatives.png", sep = "")
}

knitr::include_graphics(all_images)
```


## Decision tool
Finally, we present here the requirment of specific capacity to facilitate an intervention. We have ordered the figure in descending order of urgency. Therefore, this tool can be used to choose what interventions need to be prioritized, and what capacity is needed.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%' , fig.height = 2.5, fig.align = "center"}
cpcty <- data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx("../data/Capacity_requirments.xlsx"))

res_cpc <- data.frame (Population = rev(order_populations))

# Add requirments for capacity to dataframe
res_cpc$`OR`                <- cpcty$OR[match(res_cpc$Population, cpcty$Patient.population)]
res_cpc$`Intervention room` <- cpcty$Intv_room[match(res_cpc$Population, cpcty$Patient.population)]
res_cpc$`ICU bed`           <- cpcty$ICU[match(res_cpc$Population, cpcty$Patient.population)]
res_cpc$`PACU bed`          <- cpcty$PACU[match(res_cpc$Population, cpcty$Patient.population)]
res_cpc$`Clinical bed`      <- cpcty$Clin_bed[match(res_cpc$Population, cpcty$Patient.population)]

# Make to long
res_cpc_l <- data.frame(rqrm  = c(res_cpc$OR, res_cpc$`Intervention room`, 
                                 res_cpc$`ICU bed`, res_cpc$`PACU bed`, res_cpc$`Clinical bed`),
                        label = rep(colnames(res_cpc)[-1], each = nrow(res_cpc)),
                        pop   = rep(res_cpc$Population, ncol(res_cpc)-1))



# Make long names into multiple rows
for(i in 1:length(levels(res_cpc_l$pop))){
  if(nchar(levels(res_cpc_l$pop)[i])>35){
    cut_i <- last(which(strsplit(levels(res_cpc_l$pop)[i], "")[[1]][20:40]==" "))+20 #Find place to cut
    levels(res_cpc_l$pop)[i] <- paste(substr(levels(res_cpc_l$pop)[i],

                                             start=cut_i,
                                             stop=nchar(levels(res_cpc_l$pop)[i])),
